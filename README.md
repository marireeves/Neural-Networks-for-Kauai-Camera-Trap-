# Neural-Networks-for-Kauai-Camera-Trap-
This project uses keras and tensorflow based deep neural network models to classify camera trap data from a rat trapping grid in Kauai, 
Hawai'i

It includes R code run through R Studio launched in Anaconda Navigator, using the keras package in R to run tensorflow as a backend
to power the neural net models. . 


Our goal is to pre-sort camera trap data of wildlife to lessen the need for photo review by humans, which is labor intensive. 

The code relies on the following resources:
